## Guide for the code generating the figures of *Berthier, Bach, Gaillard - Accelerated Gossip in Networks of Given Dimension using Jacobi Polynomial Iterations*.


- polynomial_gossip.py contains auxiliary functions that are used in the files below.
- grid.ipynb generates Figures 2A, 2B, 3, 4.
- percolation.ipynb generates  Figures 2C, 2D. 
- random_geometric_graph.ipynb generates Figures 2D, 2F.
- comparison_polynomials.ipynb generates Figure 5.
- message_passing.ipynb generates Figures 6, 7.
- parameter_tuning.ipynb generates Figures 8, 9. 

You can play interactively with the code of the Jupyter Notebooks using Binder. The launch may take one or two minutes.

Warning: Some simulations might be too expensive to run on Binder. However, all can run on a regular laptop.
